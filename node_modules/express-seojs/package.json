  "readme": "SEO.js for Node.js\n==================\n\nWelcome to [SEO.js](http://getseojs.com/) for Node.js! SEO.js makes your BackboneJS, AngularJS or EmberJS apps crawlable by Google to make them appear in search results. Integrating it to your Node.js (read: Express.js) application is easy.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo get started with seojs install the ```express-seojs``` package:\n\n```sh\n$ npm install express-seojs --save\n```\n\nNext you need an **API token**. To get it sign up at http://getseojs.com/. While you're there add your site in the dashboard so the snapshots can already be prepared.\n\nIn your Node.js app you need to include the SEO.js middleware in the initialization section:\n\n```js\nvar seojs = require('express-seojs');\napp.use(seojs('your_secret_api_token'));\n```\n\nAfter this your ```app.js``` probably looks something like this:\n\n```js\n...\nvar app = express();\n\n// all environments\napp.set('port', process.env.PORT || 4000);\napp.set('views', __dirname + '/views');\napp.set('view engine', 'ejs');\napp.use(express.favicon());\napp.use(express.logger('dev'));\n\nvar seojs = require('express-seojs');\napp.use(seojs('your_secret_api_token'));\n\napp.use(express.bodyParser());\napp.use(express.methodOverride());\n...\n```\n\nThat's it! Requests to your app containing the *\\_escaped_fragment\\_* query parameter will now be forwarded to the SEO.js CDN where HTML snapshots of your pages are kept. To tell search engines to look for these snapshots you need to add the fragment meta tag to the head section of your views (maybe at ```views/index.ejs``` if you're using ejs as the view engine):\n\n``` html\n<head>\n  <meta name=\"fragment\" content=\"!\">\n  ...\n</head>\n```\n\nThis method works both with **HTML5 pushState URLs** as well as **Hashbang URLs** (/some/action#!route)\n\n## Contributing to express-seojs\n \n* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.\n* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it.\n* Fork the project.\n* Start a feature/bugfix branch.\n* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 SEO.js. http://getseojs.com/\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
